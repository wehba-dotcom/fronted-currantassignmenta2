Her is come explaining about, how we use this queck-project ,
this single page application work with react-router and adiffrent HOOKs,
like(useState , useEffict), JSX allows us to write HTML in React., and JavaScript.
so becuase the backend handle about JWT (json web token),and it has deffrint APIs enpoint,
and the last must send many requests to another APIs, in this way it is take along time to fetch data with sequental method, so they maked with the parallel way this the shortliy way.
 so we need to match the frontend with the same.
 we create an application with multiple page routes, and create a token include all useres passwordes to be hashing like the postman program make it.
